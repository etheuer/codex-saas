# Mission Project Plan: Path to First $100 and Repeatable Growth

## Mission definition
Achieve the first **$100 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR)** for PodHunt Briefs and establish a repeatable acquisition process that can be scaled.

## Success criteria
- 4+ paying customers at $29/month (or equivalent pricing mix)
- 8+ qualified trials completed
- A documented outreach-to-close workflow with baseline conversion metrics

## Execution principles
- Keep scope narrow: focus only on bootstrapped B2B SaaS founders.
- Prioritize speed over perfection: ship, test, iterate weekly.
- Spend time where signal is highest: direct founder outreach first.

## Next steps by phase

### Phase 1 (Week 1): Tighten positioning and proof assets
1. Finalize one-line value proposition and ICP language for consistency across all channels.
2. Publish/update a simple landing page section with:
   - outcome promise,
   - how-it-works in 3 steps,
   - CTA for a trial run.
3. Create two proof assets:
   - 1 short demo GIF/screenshot,
   - 1 before/after outreach quality example.
4. Prepare a shared tracker (sheet/CRM) for all outbound and follow-ups.

**Deliverables:**
- Finalized messaging doc
- Landing page copy block
- Demo artifact(s)
- Outreach tracker template

### Phase 2 (Week 2): Run focused outbound and community tests
1. Build a list of 150–200 ideal founders from X/LinkedIn using trigger signals.
2. Send 15–20 personalized outreach messages per day.
3. Post 2 value-led community posts (Indie Hackers / relevant Slack groups) and offer 5 free runs.
4. Book short onboarding calls for positive responders and deliver results within 24 hours.

**Deliverables:**
- Prospect list with prioritization tags
- Daily outreach log
- Community post variants + engagement notes
- Trial user onboarding notes

### Phase 3 (Week 3): Convert trials to paid
1. Introduce a 7-day conversion sequence:
   - Day 0 delivery + quick win,
   - Day 2 usage nudge,
   - Day 5 objection handling,
   - Day 7 paid conversion ask.
2. Offer early adopter pricing with a clear expiry date.
3. Collect social proof (1-line testimonial + permission to quote).
4. Track trial-to-paid by source and message variant.

**Deliverables:**
- Conversion follow-up templates
- Offer/pricing experiment log
- Testimonial snippets
- Source-level conversion report

### Phase 4 (Week 4): Systemize what works
1. Identify highest-performing outreach hook and template.
2. Remove low-performing channels; double down on top 1–2 sources.
3. Define weekly operating cadence:
   - list building,
   - outreach,
   - trial fulfillment,
   - conversion follow-up,
   - KPI review.
4. Create a lightweight operating playbook for repeatability.

**Deliverables:**
- Winning playbook v1
- Weekly cadence checklist
- KPI dashboard baseline

## KPI dashboard (weekly)
- Messages sent
- Reply rate
- Trial starts
- Trial completion rate
- Trial-to-paid conversion
- New MRR added
- Time-to-value (request to first recommendations delivered)

## Risks and mitigations
- **Low reply rate:** improve ICP quality and lead with concrete outcomes.
- **Slow trial fulfillment:** templatize onboarding and cap daily trial volume.
- **Weak conversion:** improve follow-up cadence and tighten value framing around ROI.
- **Channel fatigue:** rotate outreach angles and expand prospect sources.

## Immediate 72-hour checklist
1. Lock final messaging and CTA.
2. Build first batch of 50 high-fit prospects.
3. Send first 15 personalized outreach messages.
4. Run 3 concierge trials and collect feedback.
5. Review metrics and adjust copy before next batch.
