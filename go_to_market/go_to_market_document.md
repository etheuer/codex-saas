# PodHunt Briefs — Go-To-Market Document

## 1) Executive summary
PodHunt Briefs helps bootstrapped B2B SaaS founders identify high-fit podcast opportunities and send personalized outreach quickly. The GTM strategy focuses on winning a narrow wedge first (founders under $20k MRR doing founder-led growth), proving conversion through direct founder outreach, and then scaling through repeatable channels (communities, referrals, and lightweight content).

**90-day headline targets**
- 15 paying customers.
- $435+ MRR at the current $29 entry plan.
- 3 repeatable acquisition loops validated (outbound, communities, partner referrals).

## 2) Product and market context

### Problem
Early-stage B2B founders know podcast guesting can drive credibility and pipeline, but they struggle with:
- finding the right shows quickly,
- understanding fit before pitching,
- writing host-personalized outreach that earns replies.

### Solution
PodHunt Briefs delivers:
- ranked podcast targets,
- transparent fit reasoning,
- ready-to-edit personalized outreach drafts.

### Why now
- Founder-led distribution is becoming a default growth channel at early stages.
- AI copilots increased expectations for speed, but “generic generation” remains low-trust without context.
- Small teams need focused tools that shorten execution time immediately.

## 3) Ideal customer profile (ICP)

### Primary ICP (beachhead)
- Bootstrapped B2B SaaS founders.
- Under $20k MRR.
- Already posting on X/LinkedIn or investing in content.
- Actively seeking low-cost, high-leverage distribution channels.

### Secondary ICP
- Fractional marketers serving B2B SaaS clients.
- Boutique podcast booking freelancers/agencies.

### Buying triggers
- “Need more top-of-funnel but low budget.”
- “Tried podcast outreach manually and stalled.”
- “Launching a product and need authority quickly.”

## 4) Positioning and messaging

### Positioning statement
For bootstrapped B2B SaaS founders who want to grow through podcast guesting, PodHunt Briefs is the fastest way to go from product description to high-fit podcast targets and personalized outreach in minutes.

### Core value proposition
**“Get 10 high-fit podcast targets + personalized outreach in under 10 minutes.”**

### Differentiators
- Fit scoring and outreach in one workflow.
- Explanations for *why* each show is relevant.
- Niche focus (B2B founder guesting) instead of broad media database sprawl.

### Message pillars
1. **Speed:** Compress hours of research to minutes.
2. **Relevance:** Prioritized targets, not noisy lists.
3. **Conversion:** Personalized outreach improves reply rates.

## 5) Packaging and pricing

### Current offer
- Starter plan: $29/month, up to 50 recommendations/month.

### Launch pricing experiments (first 90 days)
- Founding user offer: $19 first month for first 10 customers.
- Annual test (month 3): $290/year (2 months free equivalent) for cash-flow and retention validation.

### Guarantee test
- “If you don’t find at least 5 relevant shows in your first session, we’ll refund your first payment.”

## 6) Distribution strategy

### Channel 1: Direct founder outbound (primary)
**Why:** Fastest path to customer conversations and early revenue.

**Tactics**
- Build weekly list of 75 founders from X/LinkedIn with clear distribution intent signals.
- Send 15 personalized DMs/emails per day.
- Offer to run a free mini-brief (top 5 shows) as an activation hook.

**Weekly KPIs**
- 75 new contacts,
- 25%+ message acceptance/open,
- 10%+ reply rate,
- 25%+ trial-to-paid on qualified trials.

### Channel 2: Founder communities (secondary)
**Why:** High-context trust environments where practical tools spread quickly.

**Tactics**
- 3 value posts/week in Indie Hackers and targeted Slack groups.
- Share mini case studies (“How founder X found 12 relevant shows in 8 minutes”).
- Run office-hour style “drop your SaaS, I’ll return 3 podcast targets.”

**Weekly KPIs**
- 3 posts,
- 10+ meaningful comments/DMs,
- 5 trial signups.

### Channel 3: Partner referrals (podcast booking freelancers)
**Why:** Agencies already have recurring client demand and distribution pain.

**Tactics**
- Identify 20 freelancers/agencies.
- Pitch white-label usage or affiliate split (20% recurring for 6 months).
- Offer co-branded pilot for first 3 clients.

**Monthly KPIs**
- 10 partner conversations,
- 3 active referrers,
- 5 partner-sourced trials.

### Channel 4: Lightweight SEO/content (supporting)
**Why:** Build long-term inbound while other channels monetize now.

**Tactics**
- Publish 1 tactical post/week (e.g., “Podcast pitch templates for B2B SaaS founders”).
- Add product-led CTAs and downloadable outreach templates.

**Monthly KPIs**
- 4 posts,
- first 100 organic visits,
- 3 content-sourced trials.

## 7) Sales motion

### Sales model
Founder-led sales with short cycle:
1. Trigger/intent detection.
2. Personalized outreach.
3. Offer free mini-brief.
4. 15-minute walkthrough.
5. Close with launch discount and guarantee.

### Discovery prompts
- How are you currently finding podcasts?
- How long does one outreach batch take?
- What reply rate are you seeing now?
- What would make podcast outreach “worth it” for you?

### Objection handling
- **“I can do this manually.”** → “You can; we compress the work and improve consistency so you can ship more outreach every week.”
- **“Data might be generic.”** → “Each recommendation includes explicit fit reasons tied to your product and audience.”
- **“Too early for another tool.”** → “Use the first month discount and cancel anytime after testing one campaign.”

## 8) Activation and retention plan

### First-session activation goal
User gets to “first value” in <10 minutes by generating and reviewing top 10 recommendations + outreach drafts.

### Onboarding flow
- Welcome email with 3-step quick start.
- Optional concierge setup call for first 20 users.
- “First outreach campaign” checklist.

### Retention loops
- Weekly reminder: run a fresh brief for new themes/product updates.
- Monthly performance email template: “shows pitched, replies received, next targets.”
- Capture accept/reject feedback to improve recommendation quality over time.

## 9) Metrics and operating cadence

### North star
- **Activated paid customers** (paid users who generated at least one outreach batch each week).

### Core funnel metrics
- Traffic/contacts sourced
- Response rate
- Trial starts
- Activation rate
- Trial-to-paid conversion
- Month-1 retention

### Cadence
- Weekly GTM review (pipeline + funnel conversion by channel).
- Biweekly message/offer iteration.
- Monthly pricing + channel allocation review.

## 10) 90-day execution roadmap

### Phase 1 (Days 1–30): Prove conversion
- Ship landing page updates and social proof placeholders.
- Execute daily outbound + community seeding.
- Close first 5 paid customers.

### Phase 2 (Days 31–60): Improve conversion efficiency
- Analyze conversion drop-offs, tighten ICP filters.
- Launch partner pilot with first referrers.
- Reach 10 total paying customers.

### Phase 3 (Days 61–90): Build repeatability
- Expand highest-performing channel(s).
- Introduce annual plan test.
- Reach 15 paying customers and documented playbook.

## 11) Risks and mitigations
- **Low outreach reply rate:** sharpen trigger-based targeting and personalize first line using current founder activity.
- **Weak trial activation:** reduce setup friction and add concierge onboarding.
- **Churn after first month:** reinforce recurring use cases and show outcome tracking.
- **Overreliance on one channel:** keep at least three active channels with minimum weekly activity thresholds.

## 12) Immediate next actions (next 7 days)
1. Finalize launch landing copy aligned to the value proposition.
2. Build first 75-contact founder list with intent signals.
3. Send first 50 personalized messages.
4. Run 5 live mini-brief demos.
5. Capture objections and update scripts by end of week.
